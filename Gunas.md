title: Some very scattered thoughts on gunas
---

One of the most interesting concepts in Indian thought is that of the three gunas. 

Commonly explained as:

>Sattva: harmonious, peaceful
Rajas: intense, passionate
Tamas: inert, indolent

These evolve from tamas -> rajas -> sattva

It's a core way of understanding many aspects of life. 

## Food

A popular application is to study which foods evoke which gunas. 

There are two approaches I've seen. The orthodox method is to ban certain rajasic or tamasic foods outright or assign vrat days where those foods are limited. The  categorization method is to demarcate foods into sattvic, rajasic and tamasic. 

Both are great starting points. The orthodox method allows you to experience the effects of the gunas without having to make a choice at every meal. The categorization method allows you to make informed choices and study their effects.

Ultimately, both methods can't be all-encompassing. It's easy to start to follow the letter of the idea rather than its spirit. For the latter, one has to start to understand the gunas for themselves. This needn't be definitive. Over time paying attention to yourself, you just develop a sense of what foods in what circumstances and quantities have what effects. 

As a heuristic from my experience, I'd say tamasic foods draw a lot of the body's resources to process. This renders the mind dumb for a period of time. You don't feel great or healthy afterwards. 

Rajasic foods capture the attention of the mind. You think about them even when you're not eating them. They feel addictive. In limited quantities they're energizing, but in an unsustainable way. You'll soon crave the next hit. In large quantities they can become tamasic. 

Sattvic food is nourishing and refreshing. It's easy to stop when you're full. It feels clarifying rather than dulling or stimulating.

Trying different foods, evaluating how they make your feel, and comparing this to their traditionally assigned guna can help get you started. 

In the other direction, studying your cravings can help you understand what state you're wanting to be in. 

"Wallowing" tamasic foods when you don't want to think.  Stimulating, rajasic foods when you want to get going, when you want to snap yourself into activity. Wholesome sattvic foods when you want to restore your body to a harmonious state.
