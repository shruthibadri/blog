Here's an idea I have for a bookclub suited to the times.

## Mechanics

### How the bookclub works

1. Every 2 weeks a member will be picked to submit reading material
2. All members have 2 weeks to submit their thoughts on the reading.
3. Any member who doesn't submit a reading upon their turn to do so or submit thoughts at the end of the fortnight is dropped from the bookclub. 
4. The reading is added to an online list that anyone can see.


### How to apply to the bookclub

Find the online list and turn in
1. your thoughts about 3 things on the list.
2. a suggested reading of your own.

If you are accepted, your reading will be the next thing to be discussed. 

### How to reapply to the bookclub

If you've been dropped and would like to reapply, you follow the same procedure as a new applicant with the caveat that one of the 3 things you submit thoughts about is the reading you skipped. 

### Other features

1. Anonymity: People will submit readings and thoughts anonymously.
2. Community: The bookclub won't facilitate anything outside the core activity but members will have the means to contact one another, organize meetups etc.
