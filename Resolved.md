title: Resolved Questions

My friend brought up an interesting notion the other day. A resolved question.

This is when a class of things no longer bother you because you find that through experience/insight, their underlying question has already been "resolved" for you at a higher level of abstraction.

This is not about insights that are universally groundbreaking. They are totally subjective. The experiential nature of these "resolutions" means that what seems paradigm shifting to me might have no effect on you. And vice versa. 

I'll use this space to track my own resolved questions. Sharing the path to one's own resolutions is more travelogue than thesis. To torture the metaphor some more, this might mean a false sense of destination sometimes. Like Colombus' India. Recognizing the false stop could re-open a question.

So, to rephrase: I'll use this space to track my own (tentatively) resolved questions.

## Cultural Differences.

`Reading list: Rajiv Malhotra, Bruno Macaes, Kishore Mahbubani, Idries Shah, Jonathan Haidt`
	
There are many differences in values between cultures. When we imagine this isn't true, we waste a lot of time: 

- A. using ðŸ¥¨ logic to claim these cultures are basically the same
- B. condemning those cultures that are different and/or imposing our values on them
- C. fretting that perhaps the values of other cultures are better than ours

Instead of: 

- D. learning to engage with people/ideas on their own terms and live with differences while still respecting one's own cultural context.

> Realizing that when people from different cultures comment about one another they're often doing A, B or C. Such comment can range from tweet threads to op-eds to public statements to the strange practice of creating lists ranking countries on adherence to different values. In general there's no use of being agitated about the misunderstanding which are more rules than exception. Instead, they can generally be safely ignored.

The reading list above contains meta-concepts. They helped break down many of the ideas that kept me from doing D. In terms of actually engaging with different cultures, here's a non-exhaustive set of what I've found interesting

`Puranas, Chinese Classics, Xianxia, Great Books, Ramanayana Reruns, Sufi writings, Books from Borges's reading list, The Christian Bible`
