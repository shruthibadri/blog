title: Resolved Questions

My friend brought up an interesting notion the other day. A resolved question.

This is when a class of things no longer bother you because you find that through experience/insight, their underlying question has already been "resolved" for you at a higher level of abstraction.

This is not about insights that are universally groundbreaking. They are totally subjective. The experiential nature of these "resolutions" means that what seems paradigm shifting to me might have no effect on you. And vice versa. 

I'll use this space to track my own resolved questions. Sharing the path to one's own resolutions is more travelogue than thesis. To torture the metaphor some more, this might mean a false sense of destination sometimes. Like Colombus' India. Recognizing the false stop could re-open a question.

So, to rephrase: I'll use this space to track my own (tentatively) resolved questions
